I don't have a roadmap for this project. I develop it according to the conditions of the day and what I want at that
moment. I will take your suggestions into consideration, but I do not promise that I will implement them. You can open a
PR for minor bugs, but if you are introducing a new feature or change, please open a new issue and express your opinion
before opening a PR. Thanks in advance.
