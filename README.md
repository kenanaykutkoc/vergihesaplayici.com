vergihesaplayici.com, calculates taxes.

When I saw [@temp](https://teknoseyir.com/u/temp)'s desktop software called [Telefon FiyatÄ± Hesapla v2](https://teknoseyir.com/blog/telefon-fiyati-hesapla-v2) from [teknoseyir.com](https://teknoseyir.com), I bought the domain name and moved it to the web with Nuxt.js to make a general tax calculator that could include different types of calculations.
