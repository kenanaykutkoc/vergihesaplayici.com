## Contributing

**Attention:** vergihesaplayici.com is designed entirely for Turkey. Some terms may sound unfamiliar to you.

There are no plans for how the development will go. According to my mind, I develop as I wish. You can open a PR for
minor mistakes, but if you are offering a new feature or change, please open a new issue and express your opinion before
opening a PR.
